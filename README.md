**Introduction**
Parking in busy cities can be frustratingâ€”wasting time, causing traffic, and adding stress. SmartPark is here to change that. Using blockchain, IoT sensors, cloud computing, and a user-friendly app, we make parking faster, transparent, and hassle-free.

**Key Feature**
Real-Time Parking Availability
Secure & Transparent Transactions
User-Centric Interface
Robust Data Management

**System Architecture**
User Interface(Frontend and Backend)
Blockchain
Cloud & Database Infrastructure

**Strategic Advantages**
Traffic Optimization 
Enhanced Security & Transparency
Scalability & Reliability

**Future Enhancements**
We plan to add automated parking assistance, AI to predict parking demand, and better integration with other platforms. We will also explore edge computing to process data faster and improve efficiency.
